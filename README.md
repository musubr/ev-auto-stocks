# Modelling financial data for retail trading 

Welcome to my repository for modelling financial data. This is something I enjoy doing using Python to help me take positions on my retail trading account. I highly encourage you to take a look at my analyses (which primarily live in the eda directory), use them for your benefit, and provide any feedback you may have.

Feel free to reach out to me at mu.subr@gmail.com for any further queries.
